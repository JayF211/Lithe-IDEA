# macOS application updates

Lithe uses Sparkle 2.9.6 for in-app updates. The existing menu, welcome screen,
and settings entry points keep Lithe's non-modal update offers, release details,
Later and Skip Version actions. Sparkle's standard windows handle downloads and
installation after the user chooses Install. Sparkle owns
scheduled checks, skipped versions, download progress, cancellation, archive
validation, installation, and relaunch. Lithe confirms unsaved documents when
Sparkle requests application termination and bounds shutdown after confirmation.
If termination is cancelled or delayed, the original update entries offer
Continue Installation, which reopens Sparkle's existing retry window. The active
installation and unsaved-document confirmation remain in effect.

## Configure a stable release

Configure the Sparkle key pair before the first Sparkle release. An Apple
Developer account is not required for EdDSA-signed differential updates.
The three Developer ID settings are optional and must be configured together:

| Name | Storage | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Repository variable | Sparkle's base64 Ed25519 public key |
| `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` | Repository secret | The exported Sparkle private key |
| `MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | Optional repository variable | Developer ID Application signing identity |
| `MACOS_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE` | Optional repository secret | Base64-encoded PKCS#12 certificate and private key |
| `MACOS_SIGNING_PASSWORD` | Optional repository secret | PKCS#12 export password |

Use the pinned tools returned by `zsh scripts/prepare-sparkle-tools.sh`.
Generate the Sparkle key with `generate_keys --account lithe` and export it
with `generate_keys --account lithe -x <private-key-file>`. Keep an offline
backup of the private key. Do not commit the export or paste it into an issue.
Both architectures must use the same key. Key rotation requires a separately
planned migration; replacing the repository secret alone breaks existing clients.

Without a Developer ID certificate, the workflow keeps the existing ad-hoc app
signing and uses Sparkle EdDSA signatures to authenticate updates. When configured,
the Apple identity is imported into a temporary runner keychain and removed after
the build. Developer ID signing does not by itself notarize the app; notarization
remains a separate release concern. EdDSA signatures do not establish Apple
Gatekeeper trust or guarantee that macOS launch warnings disappear. A newly
downloaded DMG may still require the existing trusted-source Gatekeeper recovery
steps. Do not automatically clear quarantine as part of the updater.

Local builds without `LITHE_SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY` have no update feed.
A manual check offers the published Release page. They still embed the framework
so the executable can launch. Windows update configuration is unchanged.
Automatic startup checks remain idle when both feed and key are absent; partial
or invalid configuration still reports an error.

## Publish full and differential updates

The stable workflow keeps the DMG, SHA-256 checksum, and `latest-macos.json`
for old clients and Homebrew. It additionally publishes, for each architecture:

- `Lithe-<version>-<architecture>.zip`, containing the signed `Lithe.app`;
- `appcast-<architecture>.xml`, with a full archive enclosure and available deltas;
- signed `.delta` assets with architecture suffixes to avoid Release name collisions.

The app embeds its architecture-specific feed URL and public key during packaging.
It requires a signed feed and verifies archives before extraction. Sparkle also
validates Apple code signatures during installation. The workflow checks that
every enclosure has a signature and an existing asset of the declared length.
Stable feeds embed `docs/releases/v<version>.md` as plain-text descriptions before
signing, matching Lithe's native details view. Details open the offered item's
version-specific Release URL, falling back to the installed channel's Release URL.

The generator selects at most three earlier stable versions with matching ZIP
assets from GitHub releases, ordered by semantic version. It
excludes previews, drafts, the current version, and newer versions. GitHub
Release ZIPs are the persistent baseline archive; retain them after publication.
Sparkle may omit a delta if it cannot generate a useful patch. Missing baselines
produce a full-only feed; API and download errors fail the workflow.

The first Sparkle-enabled version is a full update through the legacy manifest.
Later versions can use deltas. Sparkle falls back to the full archive when a delta
is unavailable or cannot be applied. `brew upgrade --cask lithe` continues to
download the full DMG.

## Follow the preview channel

The scheduled macOS Preview workflow builds the `preview` branch daily. It pins
one source revision and build timestamp for both architectures. The build number
is `<workflow run number>.<run attempt>`, so rebuilding a failed run produces a
new identity even when the display version stays the same. Re-running only the
publish job after partially uploading assets is not supported; re-run all jobs
to allocate a new identity. A stale or duplicate build cannot replace the feed.

GitHub executes scheduled workflows from the default branch (`main`). After
review on `preview`, the updated workflow must also reach `main` for the daily
schedule to use it. A manual dispatch using this workflow revision can exercise
the new path earlier. Changing only the checked-out application source does not
change the workflow definition used by the schedule.

Preview apps embed `LitheUpdateChannel=preview` and use
`appcast-preview-<architecture>.xml` under the rolling Preview release tag.
Stable apps continue to use the stable feed; no update-channel selector or
automatic channel switch is introduced. Preview users can explicitly return to
stable using the full-package workflow below. Sparkle uses the embedded feed instead
of a persisted feed override. Both channels use the same configured EdDSA key.
Packaging also assigns separate `SUDefaultsDomain` suites:
`app.lithe.desktop.sparkle.stable` and `app.lithe.desktop.sparkle.preview`.
Skipped versions and automatic-check preferences cannot cross channels with
unrelated workflow build numbers. Existing preferences are not copied into the
new suites; users may need to reselect their update-check preferences once.

The update offer shows **Preview Update**, the current and target build numbers,
the new build's date, and a short instability notice. It has **Install Preview**,
**Later**, and **Skip Build** actions. Preview release notes are neither displayed
nor downloaded. The installed version in Welcome and Settings includes Preview
and the build number. Stable release-note presentation is unchanged.

Preview ZIPs use immutable names such as `Lithe-preview-142.1-arm64.zip`. The
latest three matching ZIPs on the rolling release are differential baselines.
Full archives and deltas are uploaded before either appcast is replaced.
Before uploads, the publisher enumerates all release assets and retains the most
recent 30 build identities (including failed attempts), all files referenced by
the currently published and incoming feeds, and the latest three ZIP baselines
per architecture. Older macOS Preview ZIPs and deltas, including orphan uploads,
are removed. Unrelated assets such as Windows packages are never deleted.
This bounds cached-feed compatibility to 30 builds, not 30 days; clients holding
older offers may need to check again for the latest feed. Current published feed
references remain protected even if they fall outside that window.

Cleanup runs before any DMG or update upload and rejects the publication if the
remaining assets plus incoming filenames would exceed 900, leaving headroom
below GitHub's 1000-asset limit. Download or parse failures stop cleanup before
deletion. If unrelated or protected assets exhaust the reserve, maintainers must
review those assets rather than automatically evicting them. The rolling DMGs
retain their existing filenames for manual downloads.

Both architecture appcasts use the pinned build timestamp for `pubDate`, written
before the final feed signature, so the Preview update's Built date matches the
timestamp embedded in the app.

An old Preview build that predates this integration must be updated manually
once using the rolling DMG. It does not already know about the new preview feed.
Subsequent Preview builds can use in-app differential updates. The first run
still needs `SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` configured; it does not
require an Apple Developer account.

## Return from Preview to stable

Preview builds expose Return to Stable in Settings and Welcome. Confirmation
downloads the latest stable `latest-macos.json` and the architecture-specific full
DMG over HTTPS. This path intentionally accepts a lower version and never requests
a delta. It supports stable releases published before the Sparkle migration.

The stable publisher signs each full DMG using `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` and embeds
the detached signature in the architecture asset's optional `edSignature` field.
The stable workflow requires both signatures when producing `latest-macos.json`;
older clients ignore this additive schema-1 field. The rollback client requires
the signature and verifies it with its embedded `SUPublicEDKey` before mounting
or copying anything. It never accepts a key supplied by the downloaded manifest.
SHA-256 and ad-hoc code signing alone do not authenticate the publisher.

The installer verifies the manifest SHA-256, DMG Ed25519 signature, app code signature, bundle identifier,
display version, executable architecture, stable channel (or legacy missing channel),
and minimum macOS version. It stages the app on the destination volume. Native
copying, mounting and verification run on a worker queue with bounded processes.
Download cancellation or preparation failure leaves the installed app intact.
Preparation failures record the tool name, exit code and up to 2048 characters
of path-redacted output through the injected `MacApplicationLogWriter` sink in
`lithe.log`, the same file read by Diagnostics Export;
the UI retains its short recovery message.

Previously published stable DMGs without `edSignature` are refused by automatic
rollback and offer manual installation instead. To enable them without rebuilding,
an authorized maintainer must obtain and verify the original binaries, sign each
with the existing Sparkle private key using `sign_update --ed-key-file - -p`, save
the public signature as `<DMG filename>.edsig`, and regenerate the manifest with
`create-macos-update-manifest.rb --require-signatures`. Publishing that manifest
is a separate release operation; no existing live release is modified by this PR.

Install and Restart uses the same unsaved-document confirmation and bounded
shutdown as application updates. The independent helper starts only after that
confirmation succeeds; cancellation returns to the prepared state without a
helper. Sparkle cannot install downgrades, so its installer is not used here.
Normal Sparkle checks/install actions are blocked while rollback is active; a
pending Preview offer is dismissed before starting the full download.

The helper waits at most 120 seconds for the original process to exit and never
kills it. It renames the original app to `previous.app` inside the private sibling
directory `.lithe-stable-<id>`, then moves the staged app into place. Replacement
or launch-command failure restores the original when possible. The previous app
and `installation.log` remain in that directory for recovery. A successful launch
command does not prove the new app cannot later crash; real downgrade acceptance
testing remains required. Gatekeeper recovery instructions still apply.

The current app's parent directory must be writable. Protected locations fail
before exiting and offer the stable Release page for manual installation; this
path does not request administrator privileges. No project, setting or workspace
data is deleted or migrated backward. Users are warned that Preview-only settings
may not be understood by the older stable app. The installed stable app resumes
its own update channel (Sparkle or the legacy updater, depending on its version).

## Verify before release

Run the focused Swift timing harness, the full macOS suite, and package checks:

```sh
./.agents/skills/write-stable-tests/scripts/test-stability-macos.sh -- --filter 'StableRollbackTests|UpdateCheckerTests|UpdateManifestTests'
./scripts/test-macos.sh
./scripts/verify-macos-package.sh
sparkle_tools=$(zsh scripts/prepare-sparkle-tools.sh)
ruby scripts/test-sparkle-update.rb "$sparkle_tools"
actionlint .github/workflows/release-macos.yml .github/workflows/release-preview-macos.yml .github/workflows/ci-macos.yml
```

The local Sparkle integration check creates disposable ad-hoc-signed fixtures.
It checks full-only bootstrap, consecutive-version delta generation, byte-for-byte
patch application, code signature integrity, EdDSA rejection after corruption,
architecture-specific delta names, signed feeds, and full fallback metadata.
It does not install or launch Lithe or use production credentials.

Before shipping, test actual signed releases on both architectures: legacy DMG
upgrade into the first Sparkle version; Sparkle upgrade into the next version;
missing and corrupted deltas; interrupted downloads; insufficient permissions;
cancelled authorization; and cancelling termination with unsaved documents.
Confirm that the installed version relaunches and that all test applications and
installer helpers exit. Local fixture checks do not replace these installation tests.
